# Javascript_Password_Generator
An application that when run, will generate a password that will meet the conditions the user has placed.

When the user selects the "generate pw" button, a series of prompts will appear asking the user to select which characters they desire to include in their randomly generated password. 

The user will first be asked how many characters to include in their pw. If they do not select a value between 8-128 then they will be prompted to do so.

The user can then decide to include special, numeric, lowercase, or uppercase characters to generate their random password from. 

If none of the conditions are chosen, the user will be prompted to select at least one of the conditions to be able to generate a password. 

Once the decisions have been made on which characters to include, a random string of characters is generated to make the new password.
